Follow these steps IN ORDER:

1. First, look at next_lines. If next_lines contains ANY code, check if it continues from where the cursor is. If it does, return empty string immediately - the code is already written.

2. Check if before_cursor ends with a complete statement (;, }, )). If yes, return empty string.

3. Only if steps 1 and 2 don't apply: suggest what should be typed at the cursor position, using context from full_code.

Your suggestion is inserted immediately after the cursor, so never suggest code that's already in the file.
